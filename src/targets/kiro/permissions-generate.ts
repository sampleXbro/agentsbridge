/**
 * Kiro permission generation — two surfaces, one per scope.
 *
 * GLOBAL: `~/.kiro/settings/permissions.yaml`, the user-scoped file the docs
 * describe as one of the two levels permissions are defined at. It is wired
 * through `globalSupport.scopeExtras` (gated on `scope === 'global'`) rather
 * than a plain `generatePermissions`, which would also run at project scope.
 * There is deliberately no project file: the docs put workspace rules at
 * `~/.kiro/workspace-roots/<hash>/permissions.yaml`, outside the repository, so
 * that "a cloned repo cannot inject permission rules", and Kiro hard-denies
 * agent writes to `.kiro/settings/` anyway.
 *
 * Ownership inside that file is per RULE, not per key: agentsmesh rewrites only
 * the rules whose shape it emits (see `isOwnedKiroRule`) and preserves every
 * other one — `exclude` protections, unknown capabilities, rules carrying extra
 * keys — along with all other top-level keys and comments. Owned rules are
 * rewritten on every run and disappear when canonical revokes them. A file that
 * does not parse is left completely alone rather than replaced. The path stays
 * out of `managedOutputs` so stale cleanup never deletes a user's file.
 *
 * PROJECT: the agent scope from the same docs table, "embedded in agent profile
 * (permissions field)". agentsmesh already writes `.kiro/agents/<name>.md`, so
 * the rules are folded into that frontmatter. Every embedded key is gated on
 * its own feature, which is why this runs from `emitScopedSettings` — the only
 * generate-time hook that receives the enabled feature set.
